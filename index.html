    <h1> Celtic Civilization </h1>
    <p> Celtic civilization thrived between 800BCE and 300BCE, and had many fascinating parts, though
      this website will focus on Celtic religion. </p>

    <h2> Celtic Gods </h2>
    <p> The Celts believed that the the woods had power, and that trees were spiritual objects.
      Particulary, Celts believed that oak trees were doors to other worlds, and that they held spirits
      within. In Celtic religion, misltetoe is sacred, and a powerful charm against evil and misfortune.
      In addition, Celts were polytheistic, having gods such as: </p>

    <p> The Dagda, the leader of the clan of gods in Celtic religion, who had a giant cauldron
      as his symblol. The Dagda is the god of druids, magic, wisdom, agriculture, death, life, time and the seasons. 
    The Dagda was said to have a club or mace, with which he could kill nine people, and with the handle of the club he could ressurect.

    <p> Cissonius, a god of trade and possible protecter of trevellers. Cissonius has been associated
      with Mercury. Cissonius does not have a wealth of sources to draw from, so I can't say more without the risk of being wrong.
    Though it may seem Cissonius was unimportant, he did play a critical role, as the god of trade he was prayed to
    during trade and travel. The Celts were known far and wide for their amazing jewlry, and traded with romans constantly.</p>
    <img src="danu.jpg" alt="ich bin schlafrige" width="400" height="420">
    <p> Anu, or Danu, or many other names. This god is commonly thought to be the celtic
      mother god, and matriarch of the clan of gods. she is associated with flowing rivers,
      the land, and crops. Danu or Anu, well which is it? that is a good question, and one none know the answer too.
    In some texts Anu and Danu are the same, in some they are different, though sharing almost identical features and traits.
    If we accept that they are the same, then the Paps of Anu, irish hills associated with </p>
    <img src="Aengus.jpg" alt="bist du schlafrige?" width="400" height="420">
    <p> Aengus, the Celtic god of youth and love, who always had four birds flying around his head.
      Aengus was also the god of poetic inspiration. </p>
    <img src="belenus.jpg" alt="du biste dummkopf!" width="400" height="420">
    <p> Belenus, the Celtic sun god, was one of the most widely worshipped Celtic gods.
      Belenus even gained scriptures from two Roman emperors, Maximian and Diocletian.
      Belenus was so widespread that, he was the patron god of Noricum, the Roman province that spread from most
      of modern day Austria to parts of modern day Slovenia. </p>

      <h3> Extra Information <h3>
    <p> The Celts did not see their gods as being humanoid until the late iron age. Celts mostly worshipped their gods
      in sacred groves called nemetons, were thay would put carvings of wood spirits and gods. Celts had many holidays, though
      one that is still practiced today is yule, the drunken predecessor to christmas. </p>
